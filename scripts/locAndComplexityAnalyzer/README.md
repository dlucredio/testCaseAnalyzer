We used SciTool's [Understand](https://www.scitools.com/) to collect LOC and Complexity metrics for the projects.

1) Just run the tool in all projects, and save the output as .csv

2) The output from Understand includes all methods, classes, files, etc. Use ```filterUnderstand.py``` to filter the output, leaving only methods.
